To run Average.py, need to install Numpy and Matplotlib. Both of these are automatically installed if the Anaconda library is installed (http://anaconda.com). 

The two sample files titled Sample.txt and Sample2.txt were used to test Average.py.
The program is complete insofar as reading in text files and creating an 
average matrix.
However, the plot is returning an error that needs to be addressed.
