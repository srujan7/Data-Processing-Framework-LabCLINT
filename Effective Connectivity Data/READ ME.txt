This main folder has two sub-folders "Controls" and "Tinnitus" which has separate folders for each frequency band

Unlike functional connectivity where all the frequency bands are in the same textfile here different frequency bands are in separate text files

Each text file contains an 84 x 84 matrix

e.g. This is a 3 x 3 effective connectivity matrix in alpha1 frequency band

0 .4 .5
.2 0 .7
.3 .6 0

ROI1 -> ROI2 = .4
ROI1 -> ROI3 = .5
ROI2 -> ROI1 = .2
ROI2 -> ROI3 = .7
ROI3 -> ROI1 = .3
ROI3 -> ROI2 = .6

We need to organize the connectivity weights similar to how you organized that of functional connectivity.
The output excel file will have twice as many columns as one from functional connectivity since you have separate values for ROI1 -> ROI2 andd ROI2 -> ROI1
