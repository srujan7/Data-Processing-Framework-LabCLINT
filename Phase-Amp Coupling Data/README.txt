The phase amplitude coupling folder is also divided per controls and tinnitus subfolders

Each of these subfolders contain the individual phase-amp data for the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex

e.g. each text file has 4 columns

Column 1 Theta amplitude
Column 2 Theta phase
Column 3 Gamma amplitude
Column 4 Gamma phase

Theta-Gamma phase amplitude coupling - correlation (Theta phase, gamma amplitude)

The users already know what two frequencies to calculate coupling for. 
The order of the frequencies bands depends on the order in which they had entered in sLORETA.
But whatever the order of the frequency bands, its always organized amplitude first and phase next.
